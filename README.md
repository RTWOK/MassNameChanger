I recommend you to download the most recent version of Python.
T
o launch this program you need to either launch it in a Development environment or through the Command prompt by navigating to 
the directory the file is in and launching it by writing "py" followed by the [name] + [extension]. (example py MassNameChanger.py)

This Program will walk you through all the steps to change the name of all files in a directory.
It will change all the files names. There is a log provided if you need to know what file was named to what.

It's one of my first programs and was written purely for fun. It has no GUI
