I advise you to download the most recent version of Python. It will have all the necessary goods to successfully launch this program.

To launch this program you need to either launch it in a Development environment or through the Command prompt by navigating to 
the directory the file is in and launching it by writing py followed by the name + extension.

This Program will walk you through all the steps to change the name of all files in a directory.
It will change all the files names. There is a log provided if you need to know what file was named to what.

It's one of my first programs and was written purely for fun.
